    - title: How will a feeder simplify my fund operations?
      paragraph: Using an EU-passported feeder can automate the LP management, reporting and fund admin,
        while slotting right into your master structure.
        The feeder operates as a standalone entity with a symbiotic relationship to your master,
        co-investing when capital calls are made. To do this through analogue methods would cost around $300,000
        from a law firm. Finlight combines working with Luxembourg's best law firms
        with cutting-edge NLP to streamline the process so you can spend less billable hours managing
        this extension to your fund.
    - title: How can Finlight help our investor relations?
      paragraph: Having a passported feeder is a positive signal to LPs, showing operational sophistication that
        many GPs lack. In addition, once the structure is set up, our marketplace is set up
        for both passive and active marketing, so GPs can display their track record and convictions
        in a palatable way that saves LPs scrolling through PDFs and spreadsheets. Our built-in
        data visualisation tools lets GPs show their portfolio instantly on your dashboard,
        without using complex data visualisation tools like Tableau and PowerBI.
    - title: I'm an EU-regulated GP, why do I need an EU passport to market my fund?
      paragraph: This is due to the discrepancies between Member States in their interpretation
        of the AIFMD (The regulation that covers alternative investment fund marketing.) Without an EU-passport,
        you may be able to market in France, but not Germany, for example.
        The passport gives you the green light to raise across the Union without the regulatory
        risk from national regulators.
    - title: Why do I need an EU passport to market my fund to European LPs?
      paragraph: In the past, it was enough to hop on the Eurostar and use Reverse Solicitation to argue that
        the LP had courted you. Now the EU are clamping down on both LPs and GPs, handing out large fines
        if they do not have authorisation in the member state that they are raising from.
        You are permitted to send out "Pre Marketing" which would include a generic thesis,
        but if you raise within 18 months of distribution, this would constitute active marketing
        which you would require a passport for. For this reason, Family Offices are not even speaking to
        those reaching out, even if there is an intro, until the GP has authorisation.
        Finlight solves this by structuring a feeder with an EU wide passport, meaning you can speak
        to and send marketing material to an LP in any EU Member State,
    - title: What are the benefits of having EU LPs?
      paragraph: The EU is a prosperous region containing influential families with industrial-era generational wealth.
        Many tried to run their own VCs and PE firms in the fecundity of the Covid-tech boom,
        but are now looking to invest in funds with the dealflow, valuation discipline and operational knowhow
        to generate public-market beating returns. They are acutely aware of the outperformance of emerging managers,
        and they seek to use their vast networks to help portfolio companies expand in Europe.
        Finlight was founded by former Family Office principal who backed some of the 2010s'
        best performing emerging managers, giving us unique insight into the LP psyche.
    - title: Why do other Feeders pose a regulatory risk?
      paragraph: The other feeders on the market can only feed into the Cayman Islands.
        Since 2020, the EU has designated Cayman as a banned jurisdiction due to money laundering risk.
        LPs have responded by pulling away from other havens such as the BVI. Dohryo provides the flexibility
        to mature fund managers to feed into any other location including Delaware, the UK, and Singapore.
        In addition, there are no other feeders that embed the complex structuring that enables the EU-passport.
