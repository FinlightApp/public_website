In the last 20th century, competition represents a critical factor for ensuring development. It plays a crucial role in stimulating creative problem-solving skills and indeed avoids conflict of interests. However, according to Yuval Noah, the author of "Sapiens a brief history of mankind", the key to success lies in the ability to cooperate and believe infiction. The Sapiens secret of success is large-scale flexible cooperation.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Cooperation is most commonly defined as groups of individualsworking oracting together for common, mutual, or some underlying benefit instead of working in competition for selfish benefit.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
By contrast, Game Theory takes a slightly different perspective on it. As Game Theory studies cooperative behaviour by placing players in a game scenario, it defines cooperation asa competition between groups of players ("coalitions") due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperative behaviour such as legal enforcement. To put it simply, you will cooperate if the payoff is bigger when you betray each other than when you cooperate.

<b>Role of cooperation in our complex investment sector</b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Cooperation among allocators in the investment sector is, by all means, indispensable when bringing transparency and adherence to best practices that serve their needs more effectively. But is this enough? Is there a way to enhance our existing cooperation modes to unlock long term value?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The increasing interdependence of the investment community fosters continuous and constructive collaboration for greater asset allocation efficiency. Cooperation is increasingly going global, as evidenced by our ability to work cohesively with anyone we barely know outside the virtual conference room. As we move closer to the virtual world, it is essential to strengthen cooperationto adapt to these new realities. Undoubtedly, in the current times, it requires agility to preserve capital for the benefit of an ever-increasing number of principals and beneficial owners.
