London, UK: Finlight is proud to announce that Adam Denning, Etienne de Merlis and Justin Abbott Chalew have joined the company as Non-Executive Directors.

Adam has 25 years’ experience with Microsoft Corporation in varied roles. He reported directly to the Corporate VP of the Windows platform, leading an international team of over 100 people and executing updates to Windows to deliver new customers. He also served as an Assistant Technical Advisor to the Executive Office, presenting “demo days”, where he would demonstrate internal and external technology to Bill Gates and attending all of his product reviews.

Etienne has over 25 years’ experience in financial markets and 20 years managing portfolios for Ultra High Net Worth Individuals and small institutions. Etienne started his career at Citibank and J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Etienne then became CIO of Signia Wealth, a UK based family office, managing multi-asset portfolios. Etienne founded Kendar Advisors, a multi-family office dedicated to Ultra High Net Worth Individuals.

Justin has worked as Chief Technology Officer across startup and scale-up technology businesses, and in designing and executing digital transformation and programme management at large corporates in the UK and US. He has domain experience in FinTech and in delivering secure and scalable platforms.

“We are fortunate to have Adam, Etienne and Justin join us as non-executive directors at Finlight”, says J-B Tanqueray, Co-Founder at Finlight. “We are at a critical moment of business growth, and we believe ourselves to be well-positioned, particularly in this moment of crisis, to help family offices and wealth managers unlock productivity, streamline their operational processes and embrace digital technologies.”

“I see a wealth of opportunity for this company, with its intention to simplify, automate and – vitally – add software intelligence to the difficult and challenging role a family office, and by extension, the whole of wealth management, faces in today’s complex environment,” says Adam Denning. “I am thrilled to be part of the Finlight adventure”, says Etienne de Merlis. “Finlight is well-positioned to become the leader in family office solutions and fill a gap for which only partial solutions are currently available.” “Finlight makes it simple for family office managers to report on portfolio assets, and enables advanced analytics, stress testing and scenario analysis, as well as peer benchmarking,” says Justin Abbott Chalew. “I am looking forward to assisting with the technology strategy as Finlight continues to grow.”
